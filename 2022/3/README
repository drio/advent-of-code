To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a
priority:

Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.


Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. 
What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?
